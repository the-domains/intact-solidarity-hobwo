# The AAP: An Introduction

> The unconscious is the larger circle which includes within itself the smaller circle of the conscious ... 

Sigmund Freud, Dream Psychology: Psychoanalysis for Beginners, 1921

> It is in playing and only in playing that the individual child or adult is able to be creative and to use the whole personality, and it is only in being creative that the individual discovers the self.

D. W. Winnicott, Playing and Reality, 1971

> Social phenomenology is the science of my own and of others' experience. It is concerned with the relation between my experience of you and your experience of me. That is, with inter-experience. It is concerned with your behaviour and my behaviour as I experience it, and your and my behaviour as you experience it.

R. D. Laing, The Politics of Experience (1967), Ch. 1 : Experience as evidence

The AAP provides a range of resources, networking support, CPD and social events for graduates of the Arbours Training Programme. Our graduates work in a variety of settings including the NHS, higher education, community services, specialist teams, services or clinics and private practice. While the majority of us are based in London we feel privileged to have a diversity of graduates across the UK, Europe and as far afield as New Zealand, South Africa and the US.

The background of Arbours is in the provision of care in a community setting, either as long term communities or in a shorter term Crisis Centre. The philosophy is that of group or community collaboration. This has given Arbours graduates the opportunity to participate in not only individual therapeutic work, but gain experience of the way in which individuals can play out and, sometimes, resolve their difficulties in the immediacy of other people.

Further details of the work of Arbours are [here][0].

The diversity of the Arbours training background leads Association members into various roles, often in team and group settings.

Many of our therapists are available as speakers and teachers with particular areas of interest and expertise for the provision of training courses, supervision and group work within specialist teams or clinics.
