Freud like Tancredi was pretty pessimistic about social change, despite at the beginning of his career recognising the profound effects of trauma and inequality on his patients.

We also have to interpret thoughts, feelings and behaviours in their social context. In his lecture, David Morgan will provide a framework to address these issues.

The AAP Lecture Series covers a wide range of topics of interest to professionals in the psychotherapeutic and allied team area as well as to individuals.

We encourage participation and interesting debate. We are always interested in different approaches, how we can learn and be enriched by each other.
