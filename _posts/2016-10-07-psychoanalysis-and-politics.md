### **Clement House (rm 2.05)**  
**LSE **  
**London**  
**WC2A 2AE**

In times of political turmoil, where does one turn to for insight? Faith is the persistence and continuity of humanity. (**Updike**)

"Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold"? (**Yeats**).

"The old is dying and the new cannot be born; in this interregnum a great variety of morbid symptoms appear" (**Gramici**)

"Everything must change so that everything can stay the same." (**Tancredi** in "**The Leopard**")

**Freud** like **Tancredi** was pretty pessimistic about social change, despite at the beginning of his career recognising the profound effects of trauma and inequality on his patients. He contributed enormously to our understanding of the mind. However, nothing human can be understood in the abstract. We also have to interpret thoughts, feelings and behaviours in their social context. In his lecture **David Morgan** will provide a framework to address these issues.

### **Part One** will deal with "**Migration, Trauma and Identity**"

### **Part Two** will be on "**Inflammatory Projective Identification in Political Rhetoric.**"

**DAVID MORGAN** is a consultant psychotherapist and psychoanalyst both in the **NHS** and private practice. He worked for many years as a Consultant at the **Portman Clinic**.

He is a training/supervising analyst of the **BPA**; Fellow of the **BPAS**; training therapist/supervisor of the **BPF** and **Tavistock Clinic**; Organiser and Chair of the "**Political Mind Seminars**" at the **Institute of Psychoanalysis**; **Honorary Senior Lecturer** at **City University**, **London** and **Essex University**.

He is the presenter of "**Frontier Psychoanalyst**" and has also broadcast on **BBC Radio 4** on various topics. He lectures on a variety of subjects within the **UK** and abroad, and was main guest speaker with **Ruth McCall** at the **Freud Conference**, **Melbourne**, **Australia 2016**. He is the guest speaker at the **Bob Gosling Memorial Lecture 2017**.
