## Understanding Adolescence: Creativity, Disturbance and the Developmental Process.

Adolescence is perhaps the most difficult and drastic phase in human development.  
Although not an illness or trauma, it is full of major physical and psychological changes that may lead to serious and possible fatal pathological consequences.  
In this paper I will look at the developmental tasks that face the adolescent and consider how these are negotiated. I will also illustrate this with some clinical work, of an analysis with a very worrying adolescent.  
It will, I hope, show how difficulties are tackled psychoanalytically and the enormous anxiety and terror adolescents project into those around them.
