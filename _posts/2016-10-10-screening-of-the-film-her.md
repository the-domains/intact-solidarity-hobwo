### **HER (USA 2013, 121 minutes)**

Written and directed by **Spike Jonze**, this film is a moving love story between a middle-aged man undergoing an existential crisis (Theodore, played by Joaquin Phoenix) and the disembodied voice of 'Samantha' (Scarlett Johansson), a young woman who only exists in the virtual world as an Operating System. I shall discuss the film from a psychoanalytic perspective, focusing on the role played by voices and bodies in intimate relationships, including psychotherapeutic ones. In this connection, I shall refer to the now frequent phenomenon of carrying out analytic sessions through such devices as Skype.

He works in private practice in London, is a trustee of the Freud Museum, a member of the IPA Committee on Psychoanalysis and Culture, and the director of the European Psychoanalytic Film Festival.
