# **Barbara Taylor**

## **In conversation with Morton Schatzman**

**Freud Museum, 20 Maresfield Gardens, London NW3 5SX**

### **Saturday 16 May 2015 Spring Conference 10.00am -- 12.30pm with coffee on arrival**

Barbara Taylor will talk about her recent book "The Last Asylum: a Memoir of Madness in our Times" (Penguin 2014). This honest, thought provoking and beautifully written memoir is the story of the author's madness years, the long psychoanalytic treatment and the admissions to psychiatric hospital. This is set inside the wider story of the end of the asylum system in the twentieth century.

**Dr BARBARA TAYLOR** is a historian whose previous books include the award-winning study

"Eve and the New Jerusalem: Socialism and Feminism in the Nineteenth Century" (1983),

the intellectual biography "Mary Wollstonecraft and The Feminist Imagination" (2003), and "On Kindness" (2009), a defence of fellow feeling co-written with the psychoanalyst Adam Phillips. She is a long standing editor of the leading history publication "History Workshop Journal", and a director of the Raphael Samuel History Centre. She teaches history and English at Queen Mary University of London.

**Dr MORTON SCHATZMAN** trained as a medical doctor and psychiatrist in New York. He came to London in 1967 to work with severely disturbed people in non hospital settings. He has worked individually and in communities with many such people. He is a founder member of the Arbours Association and is Chairman of the Arbours Trustees. He is the author of two books which are case histories of people in severe distress, Soul Murder: Persecution in the Family and The Story of Ruth.
