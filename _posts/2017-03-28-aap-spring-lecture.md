  All cultures develop their own modes of selfexplanation, but such
  explanations, somewhat like symptoms, inevitably conceal as much as they
  reveal. In this sense psychoanalysis may be well placed to enter into a
  critical relationship with the forms of consciousness that characterise our
  age. The ideology

  of the market has so penetrated into social consciousness that it appears as
  "normality", but this normality can be problematic. The presentation will,
  then, fall into two parts. In the first some broad socio-cultural
  considerations will be offered as regards our contemporary world with an
  emphasis on its impact upon mental health.  Special reference will then be
  made to the work of the Fitzjohn's Unit, a specialist service based within the
  Adult Department of the Tavistock Clinic, that provides a unique

  psychotherapeutic treatment for patients enduring severe psychiatric
  disorders. The lecture will then focus on the deterioration in psychiatric
  care. This deterioration creates an environment which is increasingly hostile
  to the kind of thinking that psychoanalysis represents. This latter part
  should hopefully be understood in the context of the former exploration.

All cultures develop their own modes of selfexplanation, but such explanations, somewhat like symptoms, inevitably conceal as much as they reveal.
