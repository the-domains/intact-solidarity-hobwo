# **About this website**

The **Association of Arbours Psychotherapists** is the professional association for therapist who have trained with **[The Arbours Association][0]**.

We are responsible for holding the registration of our members, the relationship between our professional body and others, in particular our immediate umbrella organisation CPJA ([Council for Psychoanalysis and Jungian Analysis][1]) and the UKCP ([UKCP][2]).

We take an active interest in ethics, access to psychotherapy services both in terms of cost, physical access and "equal opportunity", that is to say promoting understanding therapy without excluding preconceptions or prejudice. We encourage the engagement of our members in developing their own practices.

We organise various continued professional development (CPD) events including a public lecture series.

The forthcoming lecture on 26 November is **Psychoanalysis and Politics** given by **David Morgan**. Further details can be found here.
