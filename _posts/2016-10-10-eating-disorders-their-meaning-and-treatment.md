[Next Lecture - Her][0]

⎯⎯⎯

# **Eating Disorders**

## **Their meaning and treatment**

## **Annual Conference** 10.00am -- 1.00pm followed by lunch

## Held at the LSE, London, WC2A 2AE

## **November Saturday 21 2015 Public Lecture**

## **MARILYN LAWRENCE**

**Psychoanalyst**, originally trained as a social worker, was involved in training social workers in university settings. She has worked for many years at the Tavistock Clinic and in private practice and has a life long interest in mental health and illness and in eating disorders.

In her lecture Marilyn Lawrence will attempt to understand not only more about eating disorders, but also about ourselves and our interest in them. The early psychoanalysts, including Freud, were interested in the meaning of eating disorders --although the most extreme forms of anorexia and bulimia seem to be a complete denial of meaning and a retreat into meaningless.

## **BRYONY BAMFORD**

**Consultant Clinical Psychologist** and **Honorary Research Fellow** at **St. Georges, University of London**, is the **Clinical Director** of the **London Centre for Eating Disorders**. She specializes in the in-patient and out-patient treatment of severe anorexia nervosa and regularly presents and publishes on this topic.

In her presentation Bryony Bamford will provide an overview of the way in which treatments may need to be adapted in order to address the factors that tend to precipitate and perpetuate food related difficulties.

Adaptations for restrictive and binge/purge presentations will be addressed.

Different formulations will be presented and treatment plans discussed.
